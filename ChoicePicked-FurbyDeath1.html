    <p>Ending 1 -</p>
    <br>
    <p>Dipshit stands in defiance at the glimmering screen in front of him. He knows he’s through. He knows it is finally over, he’s going to be free. And so with a final click of the mouse, dipshit breathes in the fresh crisp air for a last time. *click* The world starts spinning, stretching his body, falling into a void of nothing. No air, no heat, no feeling, but at the same time there was everything. As suddenly as it had started, it ended. He felt a bed below him, and heard the whirling of machines that surrounded him. Dipshit’s mind seemed to be tumbling around in his head, unused to the feeling of an actual, physical body. His eyes opened with an almost inhumane effort, and focused ever so slowly. A room. Concrete. Dim and damp. Beds on either side of him, all filled with human figures. Dipshit tried to move his legs over the side of the bed, but nothing. “Oh god”, he thought. He had forgotten that when you don’t use any of your muscles for over 10 years, your body gets rid of them. He was stuck there, waiting. But then, a noise came from down the hall in front of him, and a shadowy figure appeared. “No.. NO! NO, PLEASE NO”, he croaked. “I’m sorry Dipshit, I must do this.” And it took a step towards him.
