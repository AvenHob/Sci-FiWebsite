    <p>Our story is about a post-apocalyptic world where there was some type of nuclear war, and the planet is not toxic and inhabitable, but some rich people survived and are now living in a bunker. But, they all hate living in the bunker because it sucks, but they can’t go outside. So they decide to create a massive simulation and put everyone into it so they live out the rest of their lives in there, but this one kid doesn’t like that and tries to escape in multiple ways, which you can choose. There are no happy endings in our story, and every choice will lead to eventual death. It connects a lot of dystopian themes we saw in the many movies and short stories we read.

    Like how the rich controlling people and getting to live while others die, and also a big theme in this story is control. Everything people do is controlled in some way by the “leaders” of the bunker, even if they don’t see it themselves. For instance, they are forced to live in certain areas, do certain things, and can’t even escape even if they wanted to. Which is why our main character, Garret, wants to escape so badly, or die trying, or kill everybody else along with him to end it for everyone, free everybody.
