    <p>The war was above, but they were sent below. Privileged few had the means to escape the new toxicity of the atmosphere. The rich, the connected, the lucky; all shuffled down the long and winding stairs, dim sunshine quickly replaced with harsh buzzing of fluorescent lights. Each step echoed loudly, drawing swirling dust up from still unfinished bunker walls. But the silence of voices was deafening.
    </p>
    
    <p>Days passed down in that small, cramped bunker. Then weeks, and months, drawing one year to a close, and then two. The people convened and decided something had to be done to combat their ever looming boredom and unrest. There was nothing new, nothing to do, nowhere to go, nothing to see. And so a plan was developed. To create a new world, a virtual one, where the people could live out their lives with some semblance of happiness. Because even if their new world wouldn’t be quite real, it couldn’t be worse than those endless concrete walls, day after day after day.
    </p>
    
    <p>The plan set into motion that very night, and worked on feverishly by all occupants of that bunker, no matter the skill level, as they were desperate to escape from their current reality. The end result was a device that attached to the side of the user's head, upon which it would send your body into a coma-like state and transport your mind into a fabricated reality filled with anything you could want. But once in, nobody wanted out. 
    </p>
    
    <p>Leaders soon became paranoid of their obvious vulnerability while their physical bodies were in that perpetually frozen state, and soon began to limit, and eventually ban others from leaving their new world. People were soon taken from their private paradises and allowed only to live in select places; to be kept under surveillance. In-simulation barriers were created to make sure nobody left; just in case someone felt the implausible need to leave their now perfect lives. AI were then created to tend to everyones now unused and uncared for physical bodies, keeping the mind safe. And so slowly, ever so slowly, it came to a point where every single person in that bunker was trapped in that virtual world without escape, forever. Most never even thought of leaving, internally shuddering at even the slightest glance into those memories of endless damp, grey, concrete walls. Because, of course, they were safe here. And so it was. People lived for years, and soon decades in these artificial worlds with no desire to return. As long as the brain was safe, they were safe there. until their organs eventually failed from old age and killed them.

    <p>But our story doesn’t follow a group, but an individual by the name of Dipshit. Dipshit was brought into the bunker as only a small child, one or two years old. His parents were connected, multi-billionaire owners of a massive international shipping company. Dipshit didn’t much like the concrete walls of the bunker either, and needed little coaxing by his parents to be transported into this “magical wonderland”, they called it. Dipshit was just one of 300 or so inside that world, but not insignificant. His parents' influence extended far through him, of which he frequently used to great effect. Dipshit was able to obtain favors, hand out bribes, and have a large say in decisions. But the most valued thing he was able to give out there was information. Information of the outside world, information of why they were there, if they could leave, when they could leave, and more. And every single scrap was vastly important to Dipshit, but not for the usual reasons of the people surrounding him. They wanted it for blackmailing, rumors, and power. DIpshit wanted it for a chance at something new; a chance at escape, and a chance at an ending to this horrible world.

    <p>Dipshit was lucky, lucky to be smart and capable at school. But most importantly, he was lucky to be the best coder the community had. Said to be a prodigy, and always looked to when something new was needed for the people. But Dipshit had an ulterior motive to be this motivated. He wanted to escape. There had been a vast library of knowledge about this program acquired by Dipshit over the years, and he was finally ready to use it. Still one question had nagged at Dipshit for a while now though, should he take Joe with him? Joe had helped him, taught him half of what he knew, and most importantly, had seemed to want to escape to something new just like Dipshit had.
