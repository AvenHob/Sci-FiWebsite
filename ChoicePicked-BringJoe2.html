    <p>Ending 2 -</p>
    <br>

    <p>Garret called Joe over that day. A nice display with flowcharts and graphs and an assortment of other things already painstakingly prepared in order to get Joe up to speed with the escape plan. The doorbell rings, and Garret answers. “Hey bro wazzup?” Joe says. Garret responds, “I have something I need to tell you, come inside, because this won’t be easy”. Joe walks inside, sits on the couch, and looks bewilderedly at Garret before his eyes shift over to the display prepared for him. Joe’s expression suddenly changed, posture shifting, demeanor switching. “We’ve been expecting this from you for a while, Garret”, Joe says. “Wait. What?”. Joe reaches into his pocket, pulling out a device and pointing it at Garret. “I’m sorry it had to end this way”, Joe says. *zap* Garret is frozen in place, only eyes able to move but not a single other muscle. Not even a twitch. Garret’s father walks in.

    <p>“We really didn’t want to have to do this, son. And I wanted to believe so hard that you’d make the right choice, to turn back from this path. All of us did.” Garret’s eyes were moving frantically at this point, looking for a way to escape. “Goodbye”, said his father. And Garret turned into a million little particles that all began to slowly spread out and fade away into nothingness.
